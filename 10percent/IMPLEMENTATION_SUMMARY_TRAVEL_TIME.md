# Implementation Summary - Corporate Travel Time Weighted by Revenue

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Analysis Script
**File**: `create_corporate_travel_time_weighted_charts.py`

Weighted_Time = Σ(Travel_Time × Total_Revenue) / Σ(Total_Revenue)

# Employment Weighting
Weighted_Time = Σ(Travel_Time × Total_Employment) / Σ(Total_Employment)
```
